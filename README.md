# Bit Queue
Thanks for using the bit queue system to help manage interaction with your viewers. This system allow viewers, followers or subscribers to join a queue. Viewers can use bits to join a queue and increase their position. This queue is commonly used for subscriber games and lets you customize fields so you can get your viewers in the game as quickly as possible.

## Install
Goto the queue extension website for Bit Queue at https://www.twitch.tv/ext/49qu7wv3myvul5fa7fxazo1bcsnc8j and click install. Currently configuration is not required.
If you are not an affiliate you can use Queue https://www.twitch.tv/ext/5ul5ajg49sjyrc8ezab5qqv25fdscp which does not use bits.

## Broadcaster
To create a queue, goto your Live Dashboard and enter the following details.
- The queue name the viewers will see.
- Add fields for any custom information you want to get from your viewers. This will only be made avaliable to the streamer.
- If bits are needed to join the queue, specify the quanity of bits that are needed.
- If you want to reward that one fan who has a lot of bits to spend, set the number of bits that will launch them to the top of the queue.
- If you want viewers to be able to shift their position in the queue by exchanging bits, turn 'Allow boosting' on.

Click create and your queue will be live.

If you need to manage the flow of the queue click the menu icon and 'Close' stop people joining.
As viewers join the queue you will be able to see their fields and dequeue them once you have finished. This will reset the bits they have contributed to this queue.

## Viewer
To join a queue, first grant permissions to the extension using the button in the bottom right of the panel. Then click the 'Join' Button in the top right. Enter any required fields and exchange any bits required and you're in!
