# Bit Queue
Thanks for using the bit queue system to help manage.

## Install
Goto the queue extension website at https://www.twitch.tv/ext/49qu7wv3myvul5fa7fxazo1bcsnc8j-0.0.1 and click install. Currently configuration is not required.

## Broadcaster
To create a queue, goto your Live Dashboard and enter the following details.
- The queue name the viewers will see.
- Add fields for any custom information you want to get from your viewers. This will only be made avaliable to the streamer.
- If bits are needed to join the queue, specify the quanity of bits that are needed.
- If you want to reward that one fan who has a lot of bits to spend, set the number of bits that will launch them to the top of the queue.
- If you want viewers to be able to shift their position in the queue by exchanging bits, turn 'Allow boosting' on.

Click create and your queue will be live.

If you need to manage the flow of the queue click the menu icon and 'Close' stop people joining.
As viewers join the queue you will be able to see their fields and dequeue them once you have finished. This will reset the bits they have contributed to this queue.

## Viewer
To join a queue, first grant permissions to the extension using the button in the bottom right of the panel. Then click the 'Join' Button in the top right. Enter any required fields and exchange any bits required and you're in!
